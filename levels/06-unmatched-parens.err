# Level 06: Unmatched Parentheses (E0006)
# Learning: Expression nesting and balanced delimiters
# Every '(' needs a matching ')'

main
    # This works - balanced parentheses
    let result = (10 + 5) * 2
    println("Result: ", result)

    # Nested calls work too
    let x = 42
    println("Value: ", x)

    gutter
        # This fails - missing closing parenthesis
        println("Hello"
        let y = (10 + (5 * 2)
    end

    println("Level 06 complete!")
end

# LESSON: Parentheses must be balanced.
#
# The parser uses a counter:
#   ( -> increment
#   ) -> decrement
#
# At the end of an expression, the count should be zero.
# If it's positive: missing )
# If it's negative: extra )
#
# Nesting makes this tricky:
#   ((a + b) * (c + d))
#      1  1     1  1
#         0        0
#                     -1 = balanced!
#
# Tips:
# - Use an editor with bracket matching
# - Type both brackets, then fill in between
# - Indent nested expressions clearly

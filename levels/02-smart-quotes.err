# Level 02: Smart Quotes (E0007)
# Learning: ASCII vs Unicode in source code
# This level teaches why "curly" quotes break code

main
    # This works - straight quotes
    println("Hello with straight quotes!")

    gutter
        # This will fail - smart quotes from copy-paste
        let msg = "Hello with smart quotes"
        println(msg)
    end

    println("Level 02 complete!")
end

# LESSON: Smart quotes (" ") look similar but are different characters.
# Compilers expect ASCII straight quotes (").
# This error often happens when copying from:
# - Word processors (Word, Google Docs)
# - Websites with fancy typography
# - Text messages or emails
#
# Fix: Replace curly quotes with straight quotes.
# Most code editors have a "replace all" feature.

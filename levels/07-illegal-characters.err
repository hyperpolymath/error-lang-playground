# Level 07: Illegal Characters (E0004)
# Learning: Valid character sets in source code
# Error-Lang only accepts specific characters

# LESSON: Identifiers have strict rules.
#
# Valid identifier characters:
#   - Letters: a-z, A-Z
#   - Digits: 0-9 (but not at start!)
#   - Underscore: _
#
# Invalid characters:
#   @ # $ % ^ & * - + = etc.
#
# Why these rules?
# 1. @ could be confused with decorators (other languages)
# 2. - is the minus operator (a-b means subtraction)
# 3. $ is used for string interpolation in some languages
# 4. Starting with a digit: is 123abc a number or name?
#
# The lexer needs unambiguous rules to tokenize correctly.

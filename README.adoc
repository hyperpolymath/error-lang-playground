A teaching playground for Error-Lang — the programming language where code breaks intentionally.

== Overview

Error-Lang Playground provides a structured learning environment for Error-Lang, a teaching-first language designed to teach how compilers and interpreters work by making errors the curriculum.

=== Philosophy

[quote]
Errors are features, not bugs. Every error has a lesson.

Traditional programming focuses on avoiding errors. Error-Lang embraces them:

* **Intentional error injection** in designated "gutter" blocks
* **Stability score** that decreases with each error
* **Curriculum-mapped error codes** (E0001-E0010+)
* **Error-tolerant parsing** that continues after failures

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the playground
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/error-lang-playground
cd error-lang-playground

# Setup (install ReScript)
just setup

# Build
just build

# Run your first level
just run-hello

# Or run any level
just run levels/02-smart-quotes.err

# Learn about an error code
just explain E0007
----

== Levels

The playground includes progressive learning levels:

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Level | Topic | Error Codes

| 01 | Hello World | (none)
| 02 | Smart Quotes | E0007
| 03 | Unterminated Strings | E0002
| 04 | Escape Sequences | E0003
| 05 | Missing Block Terminators | E0005
| 06 | Unmatched Parentheses | E0006
| 07 | Illegal Characters | E0004
| 08 | Variables and Types | (none)
| 09 | Operators | (none)
| 10 | Gutter Mastery | (all)
|===

Run `just levels` to see all available levels.

== Error Codes

=== Syntax Errors (E0001-E0010)

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Code | Description

| E0001 | Unexpected token
| E0002 | Unterminated string literal
| E0003 | Invalid escape sequence
| E0004 | Illegal character
| E0005 | Missing 'end' keyword
| E0006 | Unmatched parenthesis
| E0007 | Smart quote detected
| E0008 | Invalid identifier
| E0009 | Reserved keyword misuse
| E0010 | Whitespace issue
|===

Use `just explain <code>` for detailed explanations.

== The Gutter Block

The `gutter` block is Error-Lang's signature feature:

[source]
----
main
    println("This always works")

    gutter
        # Errors may be injected here
        let broken = "unterminated
    end

    println("This still runs!")
end
----

=== How It Works

1. Code inside `gutter...end` is an "error zone"
2. The compiler may inject random errors (based on seed)
3. Each error decreases the Stability Score
4. The compiler recovers and continues after `end`

=== Stability Score

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Score | Status

| 100% | Rock solid
| 70%+ | Stable
| 50%+ | Wobbly
| 30%+ | Unstable
| <10% | Critical
| 0% | Collapsed

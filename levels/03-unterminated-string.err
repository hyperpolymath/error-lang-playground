# Level 03: Unterminated Strings (E0002)
# Learning: String literal boundaries
# Every opening quote needs a closing quote

main
    # This works - properly terminated string
    let greeting = "Hello, world!"
    println(greeting)

    gutter
        # This fails - where's the closing quote?
        let broken = "This string never ends
        println(broken)
    end

    println("Level 03 complete!")
end

# LESSON: Strings must be enclosed in matching quotes.
#
# The lexer (tokenizer) reads character by character.
# When it sees a quote, it enters "string mode" and
# keeps reading until it finds the closing quote.
#
# If the closing quote is missing, the lexer gets
# confused - is the next line part of the string?
# Is the whole rest of the file a string?
#
# Fix: Always close your strings. Use syntax highlighting
# to spot runaway strings (they often color everything
# after them the same color).

# LESSON: Variables in Error-Lang
#
# IMMUTABLE (default):
#   let x = 10
#   x = 20  # ERROR! Can't reassign
#
# MUTABLE (opt-in):
#   let mutable x = 10
#   x = 20  # OK, x is now 20
#
# TYPE ANNOTATIONS (optional):
#   let x: Int = 10      # Explicit type
#   let y = 10           # Inferred as Int
#
# AVAILABLE TYPES:
#   Int     - whole numbers: 42, -7, 0
#   Float   - decimals: 3.14, -0.5
#   String  - text: "hello"
#   Bool    - true or false
#   Array<T> - list of T: [1, 2, 3]
#
# Why immutable by default?
# - Easier to reason about
# - Fewer bugs from unexpected changes
# - Better for concurrent code

# Level 05: Missing Block Terminators (E0005)
# Learning: Block structure and scope
# Every 'main', 'function', 'if', 'while' needs 'end'

main
    println("Starting block structure lesson...")

    let x = 10

    gutter
        # This fails - where does the main block end?
        # The parser keeps looking for 'end' but never finds it
        let y = 20
        println(y)
        # Oops, forgot 'end' here!
    # The gutter's 'end' is missing too...

    println("Level 05 complete!")
end

# LESSON: Error-Lang uses explicit block terminators.
#
# Unlike languages with braces { }, Error-Lang uses keywords:
#
#   main         if condition     function foo()
#     ...          ...              ...
#   end          end              end
#
# The parser matches each opening keyword with an 'end'.
# If 'end' is missing, the parser doesn't know where
# the block stops. It might:
# - Think the whole file is one block
# - Get confused about nesting
# - Report errors in unexpected places
#
# Fix: Indent consistently and add 'end' for each block.
# Many editors can auto-insert matching 'end'.

# Level 04: Escape Sequences (E0003)
# Learning: How backslash creates special characters
# Valid: \n \r \t \\ \" \0

main
    # These work - valid escape sequences
    println("Line 1\nLine 2")     # \n = newline
    println("Tab:\there")          # \t = tab
    println("Quote: \"Hi\"")       # \" = literal quote
    println("Backslash: \\")       # \\ = literal backslash

    gutter
        # This fails - \q is not a valid escape

# LESSON: Backslash (\) is the escape character.
#
# When the lexer sees \, it looks at the next character:
#   \n -> newline (moves to next line)
#   \t -> tab (horizontal spacing)
#   \r -> carriage return (old-style newline)
#   \\ -> literal backslash
#   \" -> literal quote (doesn't end string)
#   \0 -> null character (binary zero)
#   \xNN -> character by hex code
#
# Anything else? ERROR!
#
# Common mistake: Windows file paths
#   WRONG:  "C:\Users\name"  (\U and \n are interpreted)
#   RIGHT:  "C:\\Users\\name" (escaped backslashes)

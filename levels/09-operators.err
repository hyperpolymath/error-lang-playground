# LESSON: Error-Lang uses words for boolean operators.
#
# WRONG (from C, Java, JavaScript):
#   &&  ||  !
#
# RIGHT (Error-Lang):
#   and  or  not
#
# Why words?
# 1. More readable: "if x and y" vs "if x && y"
# 2. Consistent with natural language
# 3. Avoids confusion with bitwise operators
#
# Bitwise operators (for advanced users):
#   &   - bitwise AND
#   |   - bitwise OR
#   ^   - bitwise XOR
#   ~   - bitwise NOT
#   <<  - left shift
#   >>  - right shift
